This React project is an attempt to build a web synthetizer based on the Web
Audio API from Javascript. It is heavily inspired by virtual synthetizers used
in the field of professional music production like Serum or Vital.

The goal is to achieve the developement of key features from these kind of audio
softwares such as different oscillator types, ADSR enveloppe, customizable
filter and some effects like distortion, delay and reverb.
